power shall   type ▶python   after enter   3 angle bracket   >>>
bracket promt here 
just type then immediatly run 
python like js is interpretter lang 
in other words its not like java or c or c++  the application does not need to be compiled and then built into an
executable before you can run it 
the python interpreter simply takes each line of code  as it comes across it and then inteprets and executes the code
▶ exit()  out of envirement
✅same indent level   not care number indent 

unlike  c# jaava  
python does not  automatically look for a specific function when the program start
so whats happing here ▶if __name__ == "__main__":      [`d``under` name=double underscores] 
 this  check see this module  this file of python code is loaded and the interpreter has assiggned
the double underscore name variable the value of main 
thats means that this python prograam was executed as a main program its was started from the command line
or invoked from the python executable somehow and therefore this funation right here 
the main function should be called
the reason  python code can be used multiple ways my code in this file can be run as its own program 
but i could also build a reusable module that can be included inside of other python program 
so i want use the other program  i wouldnt want all this code to just start runing when it was imported into other program 
beacuse that woul cause problem
